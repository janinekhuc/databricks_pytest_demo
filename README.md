# databricks_pytest_demo

This project, databricks_pytest_demo, is a demonstration of how to use pytest within Databricks workflows. It is based on Databricks' documentation and showcases how to set up, deploy, and run tests in a Databricks environment. [Databricks' article](https://docs.databricks.com/en/notebooks/testing.html)

## Key points of the project 
- *Project Setup*
   - The 'databricks_pytest_demo' project was generated by using the Databricks asset bundle default-python template.
   - It includes configurations and scripts to run simple pytest (and pyspark) tests in Databricks.

## Some info on pytest
[pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) is a popular testing framework for Python. It is used to write simple as well as scalable test cases. Here are some key features and concepts:
- Writing Tests: Tests are written as functions in Python files. By convention, test files are named starting with test_ or ending with _test.py, and test functions are named starting with test_.
- Fixtures: pytest fixtures provide a way to set up and tear down resources needed for tests. They are defined using the @pytest.fixture decorator.
- Assertions: pytest uses standard Python assert statements for verifying test outcomes.

This project demonstrates how to integrate pytest into Databricks workflows, making it easier to automate and manage testing.
